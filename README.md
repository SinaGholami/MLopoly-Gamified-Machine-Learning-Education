# MLopoly – Gamified Machine Learning Education
MLopoly is a Monopoly-inspired serious game designed to support interactive and experiential learning of core machine learning concepts.
The project bridges theoretical ML education with decision-based gameplay, enabling students to build, tune, and evaluate models through realistic scenarios.

## Motivation
Machine Learning education can be challenging for students without a strong mathematical or programming background.
MLopoly addresses this gap by:

- Embedding ML concepts into gameplay mechanics
- Encouraging active experimentation
- Reinforcing learning through iterative decisions
- Linking model performance to game outcomes

The project is inspired by research in serious games and experiential learning.

## Core Concepts Covered
- Supervised learning
- Model selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Overfitting vs underfitting
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, precision, recall)
- Feature engineering
- Data quality impact

## Game Mechanics
Players move across thematic domains (e.g., restaurant, farm, bank).
Each domain represents a real-world ML task:
- Selecting models
- Adjusting hyperparameters
- Evaluating performance
- Managing resources
Game mechanics such as upgrades, rent, and challenge cards are directly linked to ML model outcomes.

## Research Background
MLopoly was developed as part of research exploring gamification in machine learning education.
The game was evaluated using:
- Bloom’s Taxonomy framework
- ARCS Motivation Model

A validation study using structured questionnaires assessed:
- Knowledge acquisition
- Conceptual understanding
- Engagement
- Motivation

## Educational Objectives
MLopoly aims to:
* Reduce entry barriers to ML
* Increase engagement
* Improve conceptual understanding
* Encourage experimentation mindset
* 
## Future Work
* Integration with real ML libraries (scikit-learn)
* Online multiplayer version
* Expanded task library
* Learning analytics dashboard
* Adaptive difficulty system
